### Information

This repository is rspec testing for recipe class with instruction as below

1) Write a `Recipe` class in pure Ruby (no database, and no gems apart from a test library) which

2) Along the way, add any other tests you feel would be useful
 (hint: it might help to split the single test case below into several different ones)
